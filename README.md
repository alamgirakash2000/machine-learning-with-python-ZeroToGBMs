## Overview

“Machine Learning with Python: Zero to GBMs” is an online course intended to
provide a CodingFirst introduction to machine learning using the Scikit-learn
library. The course takes a hands-on coding-focused approach and will be taught
using live interactive Jupyter notebooks, allowing students to follow along and
experiment. Theoretical concepts will be explained in simple terms using code.

## Topics Covered:

- Exploratory Data Analysis with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Download and Explore datasets from kaggle or other sources
- Explore Scikit-learn and it's function
- Build machine learning model on real world datasets
- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression algorithms
- Decision Tree, Random Forest algorithms
- Hyperparameter Tuning and Regularization
- Gradient Boosting with XGBoost
